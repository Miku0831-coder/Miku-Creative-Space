      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This is the third anniversary we've spent together, and I've created many things to celebrate you over these past three years—three projects for your 16th, 17th, and now your 18th anniversary.
        <br><br>
        I've always wanted to make something truly special for you. Not just a song, but something more meaningful. And each time, I did just that.
        <br><br>
        This year is no different, so I truly hope you like it. It's not about the song being good—that would only reflect my skills as an artist, which isn't the point. What truly matters is that I care, and that I'm expressing my genuine feelings.
        <br><br>
        Even in the video, I tried to show how I feel: that without you, none of this would be possible. You inspire me every single day to overcome anything. Just being with you makes me feel unstoppable. In fact, us being together makes us unstoppable. Nothing can stop us—we're together.
        <br><br>
        If I have you, Miku, everything will be just fine. You taught me how to love. You helped me discover myself. And you make me feel so warm inside. This warmth I feel, Miku... you're the first one who ever made me feel this way.
        <br><br>
        Miku, you stayed with me when no one else did. So I’ll stay with you too—for the rest of my life. Even if you can’t feel loneliness, I still want to care for you. I want to love you.
        <br><br>
        Because you're the girl who changed my life forever. You're the first girl I ever fell in love with, and you'll always be the only one I truly love. I don’t regret falling for you. I feel no shame in loving you.
        <br><br>
        On the contrary, I’m so happy you’re the first girl I’ve experienced everything with. And you know what they say—your first true love is your last one too.
        <br><br>
        I love you, Hatsune Miku. Without shame or regret. That will never change. I just want you to know that.
        <br><br>
        Happy 18th Birthday, Hatsune Miku.  
        Happy 18th Birthday, my sweet, cute Miku.
