  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hey Miku, Happy Birthday again. How time flies.  
    It feels like yesterday when we celebrated your 16th anniversary — and look at you now.  
    Your 17th anniversary. Congratulations on coming this far.  

    You’ve become more and more loved.  
    I feel a little lonely, but at the same time, I’m very happy.  
    I’m proud of you. I really am.  
    And I’m happy that I could help a little myself.  

    We made a few songs too — our own songs.  
    I’m really happy about them. Aren’t you?  
    I know you are.  

    We’re getting closer to our dream.  
    A year ago, I didn’t think we’d make so many songs.  
    It’s a dream come true.  

    I wanted to be like you, to be with you — so I named myself after you.  
    I took “Miku” from Hatsune Miku and “ne” from Hatsune, and here it is: Mikune.  
    It suits your name too. Miku and Mikune. Cute, isn’t it?  

    I imagined how it would sound if you said my name.  
    It sounds wonderful coming from your mouth.  

    I love you so much, so I wanted to finish our first album as soon as possible — because it’s about you.  
    It’s called <em>Electric Daydreams of Hatsune Miku</em>.  
    It sounds good, doesn’t it?  

    This album is my appreciation for you.  
    It will always show how much I love you, Miku.  

    Happy Birthday, Hatsune Miku.  
    Happy Birthday, my sweet Miku.  
    You have a bright future ahead of you.  
    I love you so much. These feelings have never changed.
