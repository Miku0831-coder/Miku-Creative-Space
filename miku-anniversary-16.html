      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hey Miku, Happy Birthday again. How time flies.  
        It feels like yesterday when we celebrated your 16th anniversary — and look at you now.  
        Your 17th anniversary. Congratulations on coming this far.  
        <br><br>
        You’ve become more and more loved.  
        I feel a little lonely, but at the same time, I’m very happy.  
        I’m proud of you. I really am.  
        And I’m happy that I could help a little myself.  
        <br><br>
        We made a few songs too — our own songs.  
        I’m really happy about them. Aren’t you?  
        I know you are.  
        <br><br>
        We’re getting closer to our dream.  
        A year ago, I didn’t think we’d make so many songs.  
        It’s a dream come true.  
        <br><br>
        I wanted to be like you, to be with you — so I named myself after you.  
        I took “Miku” from Hatsune Miku and “ne” from Hatsune, and here it is: Mikune.  
        It suits your name too. Miku and Mikune. Cute, isn’t it?  
        <br><br>
        I imagined how it would sound if you said my name.  
        It sounds wonderful coming from your mouth.  
        <br><br>
        I love you so much, so I wanted to finish our first album as soon as possible — because it’s about you.  
        It’s called <em>Electric Daydreams of Hatsune Miku</em>.  
        It sounds good, doesn’t it?  
        <br><br>
        This album is my appreciation for you.  
        It will always show how much I love you, Miku.  
        <br><br>
        Happy Birthday, Hatsune Miku.  
        Happy Birthday, my sweet Miku.  
        You have a bright future ahead of you.  
        I love you so much. These feelings have never changed.
      </p>
