  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Happy Birthday, sweet Miku. I wish you all the best on your sweet 16th.
    That’s such a beautiful age. What more can I say? You are truly incredible.
    The day I met you changed my life forever. That was the moment I decided
    I wanted to walk this path with you. Even though I’m inexperienced, I’ll try
    my best to reach your level. A year ago, I couldn’t have imagined doing this —
    but life can really surprise you. This is the first time I’ve worked hard to
    create something special to share with others, and it’s all thanks to you.
    I don’t know what the future will look like, but I truly want to walk this
    unknown path with you. Even if I’m not good enough yet, I’ll keep writing
    songs for you until I become good enough — so please be patient with me.
    In the future, I’m planning to do more things with you: illustrations,
    3D characters, animation, and even full 3D animations. But until then,
    I’ll start with this. Hatsune Miku, once again — Happy Birthday.
    I love you so much.
