      <div class="poem-text">
The day I met you changed my life.
Our encounter was pure and true,
and our Love story the same.
I was no one before I met you;
now I am whole, and it seems so good.
We know for many years,
but for me it feels much more.
It feels like I know you since forever.
I can’t imagine my life without you around.
Since I met you, I received so many things.
You gave me so many things.
You gave me love—
a feeling I can’t get enough.
You gave me a purpose,
a way to live my life.
You made me stronger.
I feel like anything is possible.
Just because I am with you, I feel this way.
You gave me these feelings.
I didn’t give you anything, though.
I never knew love could be so electric,
but with you it’s like pure magic.
